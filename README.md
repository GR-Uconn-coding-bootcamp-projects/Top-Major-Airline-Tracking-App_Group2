# Top Major Airline Tracking App - Group 2 : FTApp 

Building a Tracking App for Major Airlines using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

For this project, the goal is to build an Airline Tracking App that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills. This app will allow improved accessibility and usage by simplifying the need to want to track travel experiences for our app users. In addition, the benefits of using this application would to enhance travel experiences and have easy access to immediate results on travel plans. Our Top Major Airline Tracking App is referred to as FTApp. 

## Description

- The purpose of this app is that it allows users to track the weather of the destinations of their flight.

- The user will be able to retrieve their flight information by choosing the Date and Time and one of the Top 5 Major Airlines (Delta Airlines, United Airlines, American Airlines, Jetblue, Southwest Airlines).

- Once the airline flight destination information is retrieved by the specific time and date, the user will then be able to recieve the destination weather info card. The final outcome of this app for our users is to acquire the weather of their desired flight destination.

- Utilized topics to complete this assignment include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project showcases all of the knowledge learned in the UConn Coding Bootcamp Cohort as to date.
