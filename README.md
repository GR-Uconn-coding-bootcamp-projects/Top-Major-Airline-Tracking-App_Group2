# Top Major Airline Tracking App - Group 2

Building a Tracking App for Major Airlines using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Background
For this project, the goal is to create an app that focuses on catering to those who want to maximize their travel experience. The motivation of building this app is to allow those who travel have an enhanced experience by receiving immediate results on the weather of their destinations. This project showcases all of the knowledge learned in the UConn Coding Bootcamp Cohort as to date. 

## Description

- The purpose of this app is that it allows users to track the weather of the destinations of their flight.

- The user will be able to retrieve their flight information by choosing the Date and Time and one of the Top 5 Major Airlines (Delta Airlines, United Airlines, American Airlines, Jetblue, Southwest Airlines).

- Once the airline flight destination information is retrieved by the specific time and date, the user will then be able to recieve the destination weather info card. The final outcome of this app for our users is to acquire the weather of their desired flight destination.

- Utilized topics to complete this assignment include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
